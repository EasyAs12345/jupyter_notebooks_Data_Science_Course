# jupyter_notebooks_Data_Science_Course
This is a collection of completed Jupyter Notebooks from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science">Professional Certificate in Data Science Courses</a> offered by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/training/">IBM Training</a>.

Instructor <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~28511493">Joseph Santarcangelo</a> recommends getting into a habit of placing your Jupyter notebooks on GitHub to get practise and to build a portfolio of projects and notebooks - a great idea!  

Many thanks to <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ch-romeo.kienzler">Romeo Kienzler</a> for his instruction in getting me started with GitHub.
